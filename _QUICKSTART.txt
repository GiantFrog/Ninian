To run the bot:

Run main.py


Everything inside the 'scraper' folder are separate update tools. Click into the folder for more info

HOSTING:
I used fly.io to host. It costs nothing if your bill is below $5

TO TURN EMOJIS ON/OFF:
Go to almanac/util/emoji.lua and change enabled to true/false. Links to emoji servers below though some emojis are stored in personal servers for me that I can't give access to, so those will have to be arranged before turning the emoji function on.

I'll provide the emoji files and which emojis are in the redacted servers, you would just need to make your own server and replace the emoji IDs.
