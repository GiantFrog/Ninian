I recall you had a technique called Dark Inferno as an Emblem. It was quite useful.\n**Camilla:** Haha! You have a ruthless streak too. I can't use that technique, but I might have other ways to keep you warm.\n**Ivy:** You're getting pretty close, Camilla. Are you going to give me another of your hugs? Wait. Is this...a scarf?\n**Camilla:** It's a winter-festival gift. I knitted it with you in mind. I'd be delighted if you accepted it.\n**Ivy:** Thank you! I will treasure it always.
